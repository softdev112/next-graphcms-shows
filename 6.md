## Add `spotifyUrl` to list of Artist links

| Type | Effort (Fibonacci) |
|------|--------------------|
| {{ page.type }} | {{ page.effort }} |

Right now, the GraphQL query for individual shows doesn't retrieve `spotifyUrl` alongside the other URLs contained in Artist records. Add the `spotifyUrl` and render the result alongside other artist URLs.

## Acceptance criteria
- On [show page](http://localhost:3001/show/mama-said-30th-anniversary), `spotifyUrl` is displayed alongside other artist URLs
