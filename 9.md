## Shows page is stupid-wide, not centered

| Type | Effort (Fibonacci) |
|------|--------------------|
| {{ page.type }} | {{ page.effort }} |

Right now, the shows page looks downright goofy at wider screen sizes. See below. Tame this page so it's more in-line with every other page on the site.

## Acceptance criteria

- The [shows page](http://localhost:3001/shows) has a reasonable maximum width
- The content of the shows page is centered in the window
