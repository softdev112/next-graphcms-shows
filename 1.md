## Create show list (not grid) view

| Type | Effort (Fibonacci) |
|------|--------------------|
| {{ page.type }} | {{ page.effort }} |

Right now, the list of `shows` is a **grid**. Add the option to display `shows` as a **list**. Give the user the ability to toggle back and forth between **list** and **grid** view.

## Acceptance criteria
- Applies to `src/pages/shows/index.js` and any components within
- Grid display is unchanged
- Vertical list of `shows` displays the following data:
  - Show name as list row header
  - Comma-separated list of artists
  - Scheduled start time
  - Ticket price
- Simple toggleable control changes display from **list** to **grid** and back
