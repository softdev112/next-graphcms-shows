## Add Artist route

| Type | Effort (Fibonacci) |
|------|--------------------|
| {{ page.type }} | {{ page.effort }} |

Right now, Artist details are only visible on Show pages. Create a new route for showing Artist details at `pages/artist/[slug].js`. See the [Artist schema](http://localhost:3001/schema/Artist) for details on the Artist collection.

## Acceptance criteria
- New route accessible via [localhost:3001/artist/wolfgang-amadeus-mozart](http://localhost:3001/artist/wolfgang-amadeus-mozart)
- Route fetches Artist data via new GraphQL query, similar to `getShowBySlug` for Show page
- Artist-related components currently on Show page moved to Artist page
- Show page only displays artist name and photo, which link to Artist page
