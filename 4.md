## Artist website URLs without `http(s)` are broken

| Type | Effort (Fibonacci) |
|------|--------------------|
| {{ page.type }} | {{ page.effort }} |

On show pages for artists whose `webUrl` lacks a protocol (http or https), the `Website` link is broken. See [Mama Said 30th Anniversary](http://localhost:3001/show/mama-said-30th-anniversary) for an example. In the section about Lenny Kravitz, the `Website` link points to `http://localhost:3001/show/www.lennykravitz.com`.

Assume that, for one reason or another, the URL can't be adjusted in the database. For instance, if this app were used by thousands of artists, we couldn't guarantee that they'd enter full URLs with protocol included.

## Acceptance criteria
- All links to artist website addresses work
- They don't point to non-existent URLs within `next-graphcms-shows`
- They don't throw errors
