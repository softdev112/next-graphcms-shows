## Add ability to sort shows

| Type | Effort (Fibonacci) |
|------|--------------------|
| {{ page.type }} | {{ page.effort }} |

Right now, the shows display in the order in which they're returned from the GraphCMS store. The GraphQL query that retrieves shows (in `/lib/graphcms.js`) specifies `orderBy: scheduledStartTime_DESC`.  Give the user the ability to sort shows by `title` (ascending and descending) and `scheduledStartTime` (ascending and descending).

## Acceptance criteria
- On [shows page](http://localhost:3001/shows), UI allows user to choose sort order
  -  Could be `<button />` elements or a `<select />`
- When user selects sort order, shows appear in chosen order
  - Sort client-side, server-side, via GraphQL, or in `getServerSideProps`? Your choice.
  - Reasoning for choice included in code comments.
